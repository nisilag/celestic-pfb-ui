Simple UI to invoke submitting a PayForBlob transaction to the node's /submit_pfb endpoint

## Step 1 - Enable port 26659 (default) on your node
Ensure port 26659 is open on your node. For e.g. if running Ubuntu OS you can use the ufw firewall util (see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-20-04 for information on how to set it up)


## Step 2 - Deploy on Vercel
This code can be linked to Vercel and you can hit deploy to enable this webserver on Vercel. Not other action is needed

## Step 3 - Use this tool to send PFB transactions to your node
Use your node IP address and port number (the other details will be autogenerated for you namespace_id, data, gas_limit and fee). Hit Run to send the transaction. Enjoy!
